Demo

This code provides a demo use of the SDRAM driver. It just runs some
writing and reading tests.

Hardware

This demo is designed for an XDK attached to a board containing the
following SDRAM.

Micron MT48LC16M16A2P-75 256Mb (32MB) as 4M x 16b x 4 banks leadfree
54pin TSOP 7.5ns CL3 PC133 (class 75) 3.3V

Many other Micron's SDRAMs should work with minor code changes as well
as other manufacturers devices (like Samsung). Some of the signal
mappings are unusual, mainly to cater for IO availibility on the Dev
Kit's expansion ports (see portmap). For example, for low pin count,
the 4-bit version (16M x 4b x 4 banks) can be used with small changes
to the code.
