SDRAM Burst driver
------------------

This code provides an SDRAM burst access driver for XCore.The SDRAM is
attached to an XCore via XCore ports. This allows 1 XCore thread to
read/write to the SDRAM. XCore reads/writes to SDRAM at application
level via explicit sdram_read/sdram_write function calls. XMOS
development tools treat external memory as any other IO
peripheral. Therefore this external memory is data-only and there is
clear separation of internal and external memory in application source
code. XMOS tools might be extended in the future to support compiler
optimisations based on external memory usage profile for a particular
application. Currently external memory usage profile is part of
application software design.

The burst driver isoptimised for burst access. 
It has a sdram_write and sdram_read functions that write/read a
block of 32-bit words. Address is specified as bank, row and
column. Driver is not responsible for refreshing, application must
call sdram_refresh at required frequency (this is to avoid "hidden"
delays). Overlapping reads/writes are not supported, one row and one
only is activated and precharged per call. Burst driver operates at
25MHz CL3, but there is room for improvement by going up to
33MHz. This driver is intended for applications where SDRAM is managed
by a single thread and access requirements are very contiguous.

Performance
